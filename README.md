# Shivay_Student_eligibility-Criteria-Project
In this Project Dataset Provided to was of the Student Details from the all over maharashtra for enrolling the Eligible Student for the Internship Program in CloudCounselage.pvt.ltd  ,
We did preprocessing on the data and used differant machine learning algorithms to test the dataset,
and at the end we found that decision tree and random forest algorithms were overfitting the dataset and svm was working well and giving best accuracy and fscore
so i Used SVM Algorithm with few modifications  to Classify the Eligible Students for the Internship program from the Given Dataset .
